## Overview

Our mission is to enable all people to do the best work of their livesâ€”the first act in achieving that mission is to help companies automate tedious but critical business processes. This RPA challenge should showcase your ability to build a bot for purposes of process automation.

## ðŸŸ¢ The Challenge

The challenge is to automate the process of extracting data from the [NY Times news site](http://www.nytimes.com/).

### Configuration Variables

Three variables must be configured:
- **Search Phrase:** The phrase to search for in the news site.
- **News Category or Section:** The specific section or category of news to filter by.
- **Number of Months for News:** Example of how this should work: 0 or 1 - only the current month, 2 - current and previous month, 3 - current and two previous months, and so on.

### Main Steps

1. Open the NY Times site by following the [link](http://www.nytimes.com/).
2. Enter a phrase in the search field.
3. On the result page, apply the following filters:
    - Select a news category or section.

4. Extract the following values: title, date, and description.
5. Store the following in an Excel file:
    - Title
    - Date
    - Description (if available)
    - Picture Filename
    - Count of search phrases in the title and description
    - `True` or `False`, depending on whether the title or description contains any amount of money (Possible formats: $11.1 | $111,111.11 | 11 dollars | 11 USD).
6. Download the news picture and specify the file name in the Excel file.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all news that falls within the required time period.
